# Todo Item Template

Use this exact structure for each new issue.

```markdown
- [ ] **<Issue title>** - `status: pending`
  - **Location**: `<file path>` (and section/line reference when available)
  - **Issue**: `<what is inconsistent, missing, ambiguous, or outdated>`
  - **Expected Outcome**: `<clear expected documentation fix>`
  - **Impact**: `<Critical|High|Medium|Low> - <why it matters>`
```

## Grouping

Group issues by priority and type when possible:
- Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Type: Inconsistencies, Gaps, Ambiguities, Outdated Information

## Quality bar

- Keep each task independently executable.
- Avoid combining unrelated issues in one checkbox.
- Avoid speculative issues not grounded in current documents.
