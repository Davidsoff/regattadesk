# Development tools overlay for RegattaDesk Docker Compose
# This file exposes internal service ports to the host for direct database/storage access
# Only use in development environments - not for production!
#
# Usage:
#   Standard stack: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
#   With observability: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
#
# Note: Jaeger and Prometheus port mappings only work when docker-compose.observability.yml is also included

services:
  # PostgreSQL - expose port for direct database access
  postgres:
    ports:
      - "${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}:5432"

  # MinIO - expose ports for direct S3 API and console access
  minio:
    ports:
      - "${MINIO_API_PORT:-9000}:9000"
      - "${MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT:-9001}:9001"
